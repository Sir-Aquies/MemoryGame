<h1>Memory Game</h1>

When playing memory games i always had this uncommon question, why do they always use predefined sizes?.

So i decided to make my own matching game where you can costumize the size of the game. 
You can play a easy 12 card game or a 1000+ card game (which i do not recommend).

<h2>About the Game</h2>

<p>The Matching Game uses numbers for the cards instead of the usual images (the reason is pretty obvious).</p>
<p>I tried using colors but as i was testing i realize there are color who were very similar.</p>
<p>There are still some problems in the game like the font size of the numbers when the amount of cards is large, the speed of the game and because of how the game calculate the amount of cards, there may still be certain numbers where the diference in the amount of columns and rows is very large and can cause some troubles to play.</p>
